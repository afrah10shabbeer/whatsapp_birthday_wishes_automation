This involves storing birthday events in your Google Calendar and using the Google Calendar API to retrieve those events. You then use this information to automate WhatsApp birthday wishes, specifically sending them exactly at 12:00 AM.


Here's a more detailed description of the process:

# 1)Storing birthday events in Google Calendar: 
You manually enter or programmatically add birthday events to your Google Calendar. Each event represents a birthday and includes the contact's name, date, and possibly other relevant details.

# 2)Accessing the Google Calendar API:
You use the Google Calendar API to interact with your calendar programmatically. This involves authenticating your application, obtaining the necessary access tokens, and making API requests to retrieve event data.

# 3) Retrieving birthday events: 
Using the Google Calendar API, you send a request to retrieve all events from your calendar that correspond to birthdays. This request can include specific query parameters to filter and sort the events based on certain criteria, such as the event title or date.

# 4) Processing the retrieved events: 
Once you receive the response from the Google Calendar API, you process the retrieved birthday events in your application. This may involve extracting relevant information like the contact's name and birthdate from each event.

# 5) Automating WhatsApp birthday wishes: 
Using automation tools or scripts, you schedule the sending of WhatsApp birthday wishes at exactly 12:00. This can be achieved by setting up a task scheduler or utilizing a messaging API that allows you to send messages programmatically.

# 6)Creating personalized birthday messages: 
For each contact with a birthday event, you generate a personalized WhatsApp birthday message. This message typically includes the contact's name, a birthday greeting, and any additional custom content you want to include.

# 7) Sending the automated birthday wishes: 
At the designated time (12:00), your automation system triggers the sending of the prepared birthday messages via WhatsApp. This can be done by using the WhatsApp API or a WhatsApp bot that has the necessary permissions to send messages on your behalf.

By combining the Google Calendar API and automation tools, you can automate the process of retrieving birthday events from your calendar and sending personalized WhatsApp birthday wishes to contacts at precisely 12:00. This helps streamline the process and ensures timely and consistent birthday greetings.
